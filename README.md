# N2GTimeUsageAnalysisProject
<h1>Time Usage Analysis of Household devices</h1>
<h2>Purpose of the project:  </h2>
<p>The purpose is to process all the data (ground truth) collected from household devices (Entertainment/Cooking) in Sweden and make an analysis, in order to understand how these are used, how often and in which hours, days, weeks or months of the year.</p>
<p>Based on the project requirements and the need for time analysis of every device's usage, the following 5 classes have been implemented in Java: 
<ol>- TimeUsageAnalysis</ol>
<ol>- CSVReader</ol>
<ol>- TXTReader</ol>
<ol>- CSVWriter</ol>
<ol>- XYTimeMeasurements</ol>
<p>Among these, only the first two of them (TimeUsageAnalysis and CSVReader classes) are enough to return all the information I need, and draw some conclusions. These, also, are the ones you should take under consideration.</p>
