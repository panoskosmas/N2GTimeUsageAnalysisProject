# N2GTimeUsageAnalysisProject
<h1>Time Usage Analysis of Household devices</h1>
<h2>Purpose of the project:  </h2>
<p>The purpose is to process all the data (ground truth) collected from household devices (Entertainment/Cooking) in Sweden and make an analysis, in order to understand how these are used, how often and in which hours, days, weeks or months of the year.</p>
<p>Based on the project requirements and the need for time analysis of every device's usage, the following 5 classes have been implemented in Java: 
<ol>  
1. TimeUsageAnalysis</ol>
<ol>
2. CSVReader</ol>
<ol>
3. TXTReader</ol>
<ol>
4. CSVWriter</ol>
<ol>
5. XYTimeMeasurements</ol>
Only the first two , among them, (TimeUsageAnalysis and CSVReader classes) are enough to return all the information I need, and draw some conclusions. These, also, are the ones you should take under consideration. You can find them in the following
