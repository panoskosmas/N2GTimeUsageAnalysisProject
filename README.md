# N2GTimeUsageAnalysisProject
<h1>Time Usage Analysis of Household devices</h1>
<h2>Purpose of the project:  </h2>
<p>The purpose is to process all the data (ground truth) collected from household devices (Entertainment/Cooking) in Sweden and make an analysis in order to conduct some conslusions on how these are used, how often, which hours, days, weeks or months of the year.</p>
<p>Based on the project requirements and the need for time analysis of every device's usage, the following 5 classes have been implemented in Java. Two of them (TimeUsageAnalysis and CSVReader classes) return all the information I need to draw some conclusions and these are the ones you should take under consideration.</p>
